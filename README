-- Notifications

Synopsis
--------
A super simple no configuration notification system.

Usage
-----
Messages are generated like shown below. Each message automatically disappears
after 1100ms by default. For messages containing longer text the timeout is
multiplied to giving an extra time (of 1 seconds per 30 characters over the
first 25 characters) for comprehension. The base timeout can be configured
globally or on a per message basis. You can also make a message "sticky"
causing it to "stay" until you click on it.

...
let notify = new Notifiy(document.body);

notify.queueMessage("Hello!");
notify.queueMessage("Hello!", {level: "success"}); // With optional level.
notify.queueMessage("Hello!", {sticky: true});     // Makes the message sticky.
notify.queueMessage("Hello!", {timeout: 4000});    // Control the minimum timeout.
...

Levels are applied as classes to the message. This can be used to mark a
message as success, error, etc and styled accordingly. Sticky messages
- in addition - have the sticky class added to them.

The complete markup with an active message may look like in the example below.

...
<div class="notify">
  <div class=notify__messages">
    <div class=notify__message success">Hello!</div>
  </div>
</div>
...

Queuing
-------
Currently just one message at a time is being shown.
