notify
-- A jQuery Notification Plugin

Synopsis
--------
A super simple no configuration notification system.

Usage
-----
The plugin will append to a div with the id "messages". This container div
isn't created for you automatically, so add before starting to generate any
notifications.

...
<div id="messages"></div>
...

Notification messages can be generated like shown below. The messages will
disappear after a timeout of 2100ms. In case the message is a bit more longer
the timeout is doubled to give time comprehending the message.

...
$.notify("Hello!");
$.notify("Hello!", "success"); // With optional level.
...

Levels are applied as classes to the message. This can be used to mark a
message as success, error, etc and styled accordingly.
