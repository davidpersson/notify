notify
-- A jQuery Notification Plugin

Synopsis
--------
A super simple no configuration notification system.

Features
--------
- No configuration required
- Message-queuing
- Message-flooding prevention
- "Smart" timeout

Usage
-----
As the first and only preparation step you'll have to add a container div to
your document. Once the container is in place the plugin will start appending
a message each time you generate call $.notify().

...
<div id="messages"></div>
...

Messages are generated like shown below. Each message automatically disappears
after 2100ms. For messages containing longer text the timeout is doubled to
give time for comprehension.

...
$.notify("Hello!");
$.notify("Hello!", "success"); // With optional level.
...

Levels are applied as classes to the message. This can be used to mark a
message as success, error, etc and styled accordingly.

The complete markup with an active message may look like in the example below.

...
<div id="messages">
	<div class="message success">Hello!</div>
</div>
...

Queuing
-------
Currently just one message at a time is being shown. Only 2 messages are
actually queued to prevent flooding the notification system. This may lead to
messages being discarded - which is bad. On the other hand it's freeing you
from implementing your own buffering mechanisms - which is good.
